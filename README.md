Lab 9: Finalizing Your Learning Portfolio

1) What is the purpose of this Git repository?

One general purpose of this repository (which I learned the hard way), is to have a way to 
backup your code just in case your computer fails or you lose the code on your local computer. As well, if you change your code, but it works worse than it did before, Git can be used to revert back to older versions of your code. One specific purpose of this Git repository for our
class is that we can transform it into a portfolio for later.

2) What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment was the second assignment, the Marauder's Map. This was my favorite assignment because I found that learning how to use the Google Maps API was very tangible and fun to implement because I use Google Maps regularly. I also enjoyed the visual feedback of seeing my own location on Google Maps and I personally thrive from seeing visual results (ie user pins appearing on google maps) more than just an ouputted JSON of a user's latitude and longitude.

3) How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I think I have grown so much from day 1 until now in this course. In terms of my learning style, I practiced googling and solving specific issues on my own more in this class than I did in either comp 11 or 15. I found that I received help from TAs and the professor more on how to correctly install software and to push to github than I did with logic or comprehension questions because those on the whole could be explained online or my a fellow classmate.

In terms of language skills, I learned html, css, and javascript. I also have a better understanding of the differences between frontend and backend. Especially on the backend side, I understand how heroku, node.js, and monogodb all fit together. 

4) What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

One important thing that I learned in this class is asynchronous programing. I learned this when we learned about XML Http Requests and coding in Javascript. Previously, I had no idea what asynchronous programing meant, but it's applicable to more to just Javascript (node.js uses asynchronous programming as well) and is important to understand when learning new languages and programs.

Another important thing I learned this semester was to not reinvent the wheel. I particularly learned this while working on the group project. I primarily worked on designing the visuals for the project, but found it to be difficult to translate the visual I designed to the exact html and css attributes. However, my group members and I learned how to use Bootstrap and used Bootstrap's templates to similarly replicate my designs. Using Bootstrap made the process faster, easier, and cleaner. It was a bester use of time to use the layout Bootstrap provides instead of struggling to make our own.

5) Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deep into?

Now that I have finished the course, I would like to delve more into interface design. While I have gained a greater appreciation for both the difficulty and importance of a good backend server, I am more interested in the visuals of a website and how people interact with it.
