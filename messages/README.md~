Lab 6

1) I accurately completed practicing using both the XMLHttpRequest and 
Javascript associative arrays. As well, I parsed the JSON data given and 
implemented printing it on a web browser.

2) I did not collaborate with anyone.

3) This lab took me approximately 2-3 hours

4) Replacing "data.json" in the javascript file with 
http://messagehub.herokuapp.com/ did not work because of the same origin 
policy.The XMLHttpRequest runs on my local machine, which is a different domain than the domain used by the URL given.
