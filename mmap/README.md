3/12/15

1) The project accurately implements the google maps api to take one's specific geolocation. This geolocation is then send to the secret about box api and receives the JSON file with the individual's geolocation as well as everyone else in the class's geolocation using XMLHttpRequest. The JSON data is then parsed and displays both the individual's location with a special marker and the rest of the class member's locations on the map. When the marker is clicked, an infowindow opens and shows the login name associated with that marker and its distance from the user.

2) I received help from Ming and Kate the TA for specific bugs in my program. I collaborated with Aditi Ashok who explained the haversine formula to me.

3)It took me approximately 10-12 hours to finish the assignment.
