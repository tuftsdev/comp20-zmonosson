Assignment 4: Security and Privacy Assessment of the Real Marauder's Map Server

1) I have correctly implemented the introduction, methodology, abstract of findings, the security and privacy issues found,
the technical analysis of the issues found, and the conclusion of the assessment.

2) I discussed this assignment with Zoe Greene, Rebecca Larson, and Aditi Ashok.

3) I worked approximately 7 hours on this assignment, but spent extra time playing around with XSS hacks I did not 
list in the assessment because they were repetitive. However, I played with more XSS hacks because I thought they were fun.
