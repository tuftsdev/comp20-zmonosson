    <h1> COMP 20: Assignment 4 </h1>
    <h3> Introduction: </h3>
    
    <p> This assessment analyzes the security and privacy of the sever for the Real Marauder's Map by rlarson for
	Comp20's Assignment 3. The server uses Heroku, Node.js with the Express web framework, and MongoDB in order
	to create "a web application that maintains "location check-ins" (login, latitude, and longitude) for a long
	period of time." This web application was specifically made to work with Comp20's Assignment 2 to create a 
	Marauder's Map. This Marauder's Map takes the login names, latitudes and longitudes stored in the database and
	outputs each login on Google Maps based on the location stored on the server. For this particular assessment,
	outlines potential vulnerabilities found in the server in the web application.
    </p>
    
    <h3> Methodology </h3>
    
    <p> The methodology used for finding security and privacy vulnerabilities was primarily using the "black box"
	method. The "black box" method entails hacking and editing the code without understanding how it fundametnally
	works or runs. The vulnerabilities were testing by using curl commands (i.e. curl --data "login=param&lat=param&lng=param"
	http://assignment-3.herokuapp.com/sendLocation) to send parameters to the database and searching for data by directly inputting
	into the URL (i.e. assignment-3.herokuapp.com/location.json?login=mchow). After using the "black box" method to test the
	vulnerabilites, the code was looked over to find the specific points that these issues could have occurred.
    </p>
    
    <h3> Abstract of Findings </h3>
    <p>  Many of the vulnerabilities discovered in this assessment occurred because the server trusts the user that the data that
	 he or she is inputting is good data. Bad data is something that could change what is viewed on the website or allows for users
	 to view the "what should be private" data inputted by other individuals and therefore is breaking the privacy that those 
	 other individuals thought they had. One main recommendation for fixing these vulnerabilites is to check and clean both the input
	 sent by the users before entering it in the database as well as to check and clean the data before printing it on the
	 website.
    </p>
    <h3> Issues Found </h3>
    
    <ol>
    <li> Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulernability </li>
    
    <ul>
      <li>  This vulernability was found by inputing code into the login field instead of a string name. 
	    Multiple attacks were tried such as using script code to insert a picture into the background 
	    of the website such as: 
	    curl --data "'open script tag' window.document.body.innerHTML=
	    '<style>body{background-image:url(http://buymelaughs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Funny-Babies-Pictures-7.jpg);
	    background-size:20%;})</style>';
	    'close script tag' http://assignment-3.herokuapp.com/sendLocation 
      </li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>  The XSS security issue is located within the POST request in '/sendLocation' because the vulnerability 
	    resides in the concept that the code currently does not check what is being inputted unless 
	    nothing is being inputted.There is no error check to see if "evil" code is being added into the information
	    given by the user.
      </li>
      &nbsp;
      <li>  The severity of this issue is <b>moderate</b> because it is easy to redirect or covered the page with so
	    much random information that the purpose of the website becomes defeated if the login information
	    cannot be viewed and compromises its functionality. 
      </li>	  
      &nbsp;
      <li>  Proof of Vulnerability:
	    <br/>
	    <img src="Screenshot_xss.png" width="50%" height = "50%" 
		  alt="Screen shot of the website after xss"/> 
      </li>	    
     &nbsp;
      <li>  A potential solution for this would be to check and clean any inputted login information after the POST
	    request has been completed, but before it is actually stored in the database and outputted onto the website
	    when the GET request is called on the server.</li>	  
    </ul>
    
    &nbsp;
    <li> Code Injection </p>
    <!-- http://assignment-3.herokuapp.com/location.json?login[$ne]=mchow -->
    
    <ul>
      <li> This security issue takes place in the /location.json feature that searches for a the specific information
	   associated with a certain username. The code was written so that if the login is undefined, then an empty
	   JSON array is sent back or if the login matches a login in the database, then the login, lat, lng, and date
	   created are outputted to the user. This issue of code injection returns an associative array of all the logins
	   and related information of every login in the database except for the one searched for. 
      </li>
     
      <ul> 
	<li>    
	   The typical syntax would be:
	   http://assignment-3.herokuapp.com/location.json?login=mchow.
	</li>   
	<li>   
	   However, the code injection looks like: 
	   http://assignment-3.herokuapp.com/location.json?login[$ne]=mchow 
	</li> 
      </ul>
      &nbsp;
      <li> The severity of this security issue is <b> high </b> because the hacker can download all the information
	   in the database except for the specific login information he or she asked for. For this specific server,
	   this gives the hacker access to all the latitudinal and longitudinal information of each user, which is 
	   personal information and allowing private information to be leaked to the hacker.</li>
      &nbsp;
    
      <li> This issue was discovered because the '/location.json' function does not check or clear the login 
	  parameter given by the hacker except if the login name is undefined. As well, there no check of the
	  parameters when the server runs the POST request and sends the data back to the hacker/user. Proof
	  that the login does not check or clean up the parameters inputted by the user: 
	  <br/>
	  <img src="Screenshot_newlocation.png" width="65%" height = "65%" 
		  alt="Screen shot of '/location.json' and how it does not check or clean the user's parameters"/> 
	
      </li>
      &nbsp;
      <li> Proof of Vulnerability:
	  <br/>
	  <img src="Screenshot_code_injection.png" width="65%" height = "65%" 
		  alt="Screen shot of all the data in the database except for mchow's information"/> 
      </li>
      
    </ul>
    <li> Issue: Change a user's latitude and longitude with given login</li>
      <ul>
	&nbsp;
	<li> This security issue lies in the '/sendLocation' GET request. Part of the assignment was to update an individual's
	     location if they have already sent their information to the database once before. This update is completed by using the
	     function db.collection.update(query, update, options). Specifically, this server checks to see if the login exists already 
	     and if it does, it updates the latitude, longitude, and date created with that given login. However, this is a security
	     flaw because if an individual knows that a login exists, then they can use that login to modify the associated latitude, 
	     longitude, and date created. This makes each user's login information vulnerable to be modified by anybody. As well, if the
	     hacker injects an associate array as mentioned above, he or she can get access to all information in the databse and can
	     modify the information for every single login.
	</li>
