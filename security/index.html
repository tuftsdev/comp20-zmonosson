    <h1> COMP 20: Assignment 4 </h1>
    <h3> Introduction: </h3>
    <h3> Methodology </h3>
    <h3> Abstract of Findings </h3>
    <h3> Issues Found </h3>
    
    <p> 1) Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulernability </p>
    <ul>
      <li>  This vulernability was found by inputing code into the login field instead of a string name. 
	    Multiple attacks were tried such as using script code to insert a picture into the background 
	    of the website such as: 
	    curl --data "<script tag > window.document.body.innerHTML=
	    '<style>body{background-image:url(http://buymelaughs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Funny-Babies-Pictures-7.jpg);
	    background-size:20%;})</style>';
	    </script tag>." </li>
	    
      <li>  The XSS security issue is located within the POST request in '/sendLocation' because the vulnerability 
	    resides in the concept that the code currently does not check what is being inputted unless 
	    nothing is being inputted.There is no error check to see if "evil" code is being added into the information
	    given by the user.</li>
	    
      <li>  The severity of this issue is <b>high</b> because it is easy to redirect or covered the page with so
	    much random information that the purpose of the website becomes defeated if the login information
	    cannot be viewed and compromises its functionality. </li>	  
	    
      <li> Proof of Vulnerability:
	    <img src="Screenshot_xss.png" width="35%" height = "35%" 
		  alt="Screen shot of the website after xss"/> </li>	    
		  
      <li>  A potential solution for this would be to check and clean any inputted login information after the POST
	    request has been completed, but before it is actually stored in the database and outputted onto the website
	    when the GET request is called on the server.</li>	  
    </ul>
    
    <p> 2) Code Injection </p>
